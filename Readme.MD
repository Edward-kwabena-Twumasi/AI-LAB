# AI Lab
This repo is a catalogue of projects related to AI, Machine Learning, Data Analysis, etc.

## Projects Summary

### DataAnalysis
In this project, I work on a tool for data analysis and preprocessing of datasets for machine learning tasks.
It includes organizing various techniques necessary to prepare data for training into functions and python scripts 
for easy reusability. The project will eventually be hosted on streamlit for all to access.

### DataScraping
At times , the data one needs is not readily available but sits somewhere on a webpage. Data scraping is how to get that code. In this project, I will be doing a lot data scraping tasks.

### Datasets 
This folder keeps a collection of some datasets I use and find interesting

### FaceRecognition
This project contains a number of fun projects where where computer vision is used for object detection and recognition

### OpenCv-BootCamp
Contains notebooks and datasets from a free bootcamp course I am taking on openCv university

#### The goal of this project is to learn, improve and innovate valuable AI solutions to share with the world ! 

# Virtual Environment Creation
#### Command - python -m venv myvenv(name of virtual environment)
